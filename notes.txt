Did conservation of HSF1 binding.
Need to do:
	- Surface exposure of binding sites
	- How do the types/strengths of binding sites change as a function of protein level? Stronger/weaker?
	- Selection *against* exposed binding sites, increasing with abundance. What is the model? Selection as a function of RSA.
	- Selection *for* buried binding sites, increasing with abundance.

What I'd like to do next: 
Proportion of Hsp70 binding sites that are exposed
Conservation of Hsp70 binding sites in HSF1
